#SequelizedBurger

##Sequelize is an ORM for Node.js. It is used in conjunction with the MVC framework Express and is utilized for relational data. It is extremely useful when dealing with databases due to the fact that data is stored as cells in columns and rows while in object oriented programming data is in the form of objects. In this app, I recreated the Burger app from a previous project with the addition of using Sequelize.
